Given an integer array arr[] and a number k. Find the count of distinct elements in every window of size k in the array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3], k = 4
Output: [3, 4, 4, 3]
Explanation:
First window is [1, 2, 1, 3], count of distinct numbers is 3.
Second window is [2, 1, 3, 4] count of distinct numbers is 4.
Third window is [1, 3, 4, 2] count of distinct numbers is 4.
Fourth window is [3, 4, 2, 3] count of distinct numbers is 3.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def countDistinct(self, arr, k):
        # Code here
        freq = {}
        n=len(arr)
        res = []
        
        for i in range(k):
            freq[arr[i]] = freq.get(arr[i],0)+1
            
        res.append(len(freq))
        
        for i in range(k,n):
            out= arr[i-k]
            freq[out] -=1
            if freq[out]==0:
                del freq[out]
                
            inc = arr[i]
            freq[inc]=freq.get(inc, 0) +1
            
            res.append(len(freq))
        
        return res        
Approach:
      ~Use a hashmap (frequency dictionary) to store counts of elements in the current window of size k.
      ~First, insert the first k elements into the hashmap and record the number of distinct elements.
      ~Now slide the window one step at a time.
      ~For each slide, remove the frequency of the outgoing element; if its count becomes zero, delete it from the map.
      ~Add the incoming element and update its frequency.
      ~After every slide, append the current hashmap size (distinct element count) to the result.

Time Complexity:

Building the first window takes O(k).
Sliding the window across the remaining (n − k) elements takes O(n) total, because each element is added and removed at most once.
Overall: O(n)

Space Complexity:

The hashmap stores at most k elements in a window.
Overall: O(k)
