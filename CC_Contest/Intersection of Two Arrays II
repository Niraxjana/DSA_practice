Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. 
Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]

Soln:
class Solution:
    def intersect(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        freq ={}
        res = []
        for i in nums1:
            freq[i] = freq.get(i,0)+1
        for i in nums2:
            if i in freq and freq[i] > 0:
                res.append(i)
                freq[i] -=1
        return res

Approach:
      ~Build a frequency map for nums1 (count occurrences of every value).
      ~Traverse nums2 and check if each number exists in the map with count > 0.
      ~If yes → this number is part of the intersection → add to result.
      ~Decrease its frequency from the hashmap.
      ~This ensures duplicates are handled correctly.
      ~Return the collected result.

TC = O(n + m)
SC = O(min(n, m)) (hashmap stores frequencies of smaller array)
