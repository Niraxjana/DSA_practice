Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Approach *Dutch National Flag*:
          ~Maintain three pointers: low, mid, and high.
          ~Traverse the array with mid while mid <= high.
          ~If the element is 0, swap it with low and increment both low and mid.
          ~If it's 1, just move mid forward.
          ~If it's 2, swap it with high and decrement high (don’t move mid).
          ~This sorts the array in one pass, in-place, using constant extra space.

        n=len(nums)
        low,mid,high=0,0,n-1
        while mid<=high:
            if nums[mid]==0:
                nums[low], nums[mid]=nums[mid], nums[low]
                low+=1
                mid+=1
            elif nums[mid]==1:
                mid+=1
            else:
                nums[mid], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[mid]
                high-=1
        return nums

(TC):
➡️ O(n) — Each element is processed at most once.
(SC):
➡️ O(1) — Sorting is done in-place using only three pointers.
