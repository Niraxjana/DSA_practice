Description : You are given the head of a singly linked list. You have to determine whether the given linked list contains a loop or not. 
              A loop exists in a linked list if the next pointer of the last node points to any other node in the list (including itself), rather than being null.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

                return True
