Description : Given the head of a Singly Linked List and a value x. The task is to insert the key in the middle of the linked list.

class Solution:
    def insertInMiddle(self, head, x):
        new_node = Node(x)
        
        # If linked list is empty
        if not head:
            head = new_node
            return head
        
        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        # Move fast by 2 and slow by 1
        while fast.next and fast.next.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        # Insert after the middle node
        new_node.next = slow.next
        slow.next = new_node
        
        return head

Approach : 

~Create a new node with the given value x.
~Check if the list is empty — if yes, make the new node the head and return it.
~Use two pointers (slow and fast) starting at the head.
~Move fast by two steps and slow by one step until fast reaches the end — slow will now be at the middle node.
~Insert the new node after slow by adjusting pointers:
      >new_node.next = slow.next
      >slow.next = new_node
