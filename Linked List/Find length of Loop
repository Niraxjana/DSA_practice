Description:  Given the head of a linked list, determine whether the list contains a loop. If a loop is present, return the number of nodes in the loop, otherwise return 0.

Soln:
'''
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data): 
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
'''

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLoop(self, head):
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                return self.countLoopLength(slow)
        return 0
        
    def countLoopLength(self,node):
        cnt = 1
        temp = node.next
        while temp!= node:
            cnt+=1
            temp = temp.next
        return cnt


Approach:
        ~Start two pointers slow and fast at the head.
        ~Move slow by one step and fast by two steps until they meet.
        ~If fast becomes None, the list has no loop, return 0.
        ~When slow == fast, a loop is detected — send this meeting node to countLoopLength.
        ~In countLoopLength, start from node.next and set count = 1.
        ~Move temp forward until it returns to node, incrementing count each step — return this count.
