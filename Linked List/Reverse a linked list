 DESCRIPTION : You are given the head of a singly linked list. You have to reverse the linked list and return the head of the reversed list.

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head):
        # Code here
        prev = None
        curr = head
        while curr is not None:
            nex_node=curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = nex_node
        return prev

Approach :
1) Initialize two pointers: prev = None and curr = head.
2) Traverse the linked list using curr.
3) For each node, store curr.next in a temporary variable.
4) Reverse the link by setting curr.next = prev, then move prev and curr forward.
5) When traversal ends, prev will point to the new head of the reversed list — return it.
