'''DEscription: You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Return the head of the merged linked list.

Approach: 
.Create a dummy node and a pointer curr starting at dummy.
.While both lists have nodes, compare their values.
.Attach the smaller node to curr.next.
.Move the pointer in the list from which you took the node, and move curr forward.
.When one list becomes empty, attach the remaining nodes of the other list.
.Return dummy.next (the head of the merged sorted list).

T.c: O(n+m) n,m - length of the two lists
S.c: O(1)'''
