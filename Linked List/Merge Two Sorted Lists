# Description: You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
# Merge the two lists into one sorted list. 
#The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. Return the head of the merged linked list.

# Approach:
# 1. Create a dummy node and a pointer curr starting at dummy.
# 2. While both lists have nodes, compare their values.
# 3. Attach the smaller node to curr.next.
# 4. Move the pointer in the list from which you took the node, and move curr forward.
# 5. When one list becomes empty, attach the remaining nodes of the other list.
# 6. Return dummy.next (the head of the merged sorted list).

# Time Complexity: O(n+m) where n,m = length of the lists
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# class ListNode:
