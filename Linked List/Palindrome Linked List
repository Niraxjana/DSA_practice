Description : You are given the head of a singly linked list of positive integers. You have to check if the given linked list is palindrome or not.

Example : The given linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1, which is a palindrome.

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head):
        slow, fast = head , head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        prev, curr = None, slow
        while curr:
            next_node = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next_node
        left , right = head , prev
        while right:
            if left.data != right.data:
                return False
            left, right = left.next,right.next
        return True

Approach : 

~Use slow and fast pointers to find the middle of the linked list.
~Reverse the second half of the list starting from the middle.
~Set two pointers — one at the head and one at the reversed half.
~Compare corresponding nodes from both halves.
~If all values match → return True, else False.
