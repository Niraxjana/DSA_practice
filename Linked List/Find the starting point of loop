You are given the head of a singly linked list. If a loop is present in the linked list then return the first node of the loop else return -1.

Approach:
      ~Use slow (1 step) and fast (2 steps) to detect a cycle.
      ~If fast or fast.next is None → return -1.
      ~When slow & fast meet, a loop exists.
      ~Set p1 = head and keep slow at meeting point.
      ~Move p1 and slow together 1 step at a time until they meet → that node is the cycle start.

Soln:

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):   
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
"""
class Solution:
    def cycleStart(self, head):
        # handle empty list
        if head is None:
            return -1
        slow = fast = head

        #Detect cycle using Floyd's algorithm
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                break
        else:
            # no cycle
            return -1

        #Find start of cycle
        p1 = head
        while p1 != slow:
            p1 = p1.next
            slow = slow.next
        # return the value 
        return p1.data
